 * Mentored a group of undergraduate students through the scientific process, including formulating questions, making hypotheses, collecting field data, lab work, and presentation skills. 
 * Building curriculum for a collaboration with Upward Bound, DOE-funded college prep programs across the country who serve students from low-income families where neither parent received a bachelor's degree. 

**Summer Academy Course Instructor**, Washington State University Upward Bound (2021)
*Pullman, WA*
 * Co-taught two-week introductory course on glaciers and climate change for high schoolers from low-income families where neither parent received a bachelor's degree. 

**Teaching Assistant - Terrestrial Paleoclimate Course**, Columbia University (2020)
*New York City, NY*
 * Collaborated with professor to develop curriculum, managed hybrid classroom during pandemic, provided detailed feedback on homework and exams, held office hours.
 * *From the students:* "She goes out of her way to give feedback and thoughts on the homework assignments, allowing us to actually want to engage with the material and delve deeper into the subject material [...] one of the best, if not the best TAs I've ever had when taking a course."

**Teaching Assistant - Climate Systems Course**, Columbia University (2019)
*New York City, NY*
 * Collaborated with two faculty and three other TAs. Taught lab sessions, graded lab reports, and held office hours.
 * *From the students:* "I went to office hours for some help, and she and I were able to sit there for around 30 minutes and really dig into the material."

**Visiting Student**, Berkeley Geochronology Center (2017)
*Berkeley, CA*
 * Under the supervision of Greg Balco, a leader in my field, learned to operate noble gas mass spectrometer for cosmogenic helium-3 dating of samples for Master’s thesis.
